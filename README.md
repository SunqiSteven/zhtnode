smart contract is an important part of the enthusiasm surrounding blockchain technology,
so this is post I will explain what smart contract is.But first, let's quickly recap of
the magic analogy I use in my previous post to explain a blockchain. A public blockchain can
be imagined in the following way:
    * An identical agreement is written on a set of enchanted documents;
    * Anyone can take part in maintaining this agreement by owning one of these documents
    * Rules describe changes you are allowed to make to a document;
    * Any valid changes to one document is automatically made to all the other documents.
